This repository contains example files for the article "Tree imbalance causes a bias in phylogenetic estimation of evolutionary timescales using heterochronous sequences".

We have included four example files for each of heterochronous and isochronous datasets:

1. The XML files for input to BEASTv2.1.1.
2. The simulated trees in newick format.
3. The R script used to run the analysis and process the data (note that to be reproduced the paths must be changed).
4. The tree estimated using BEASTv2.1.1

For further information or data contact David Duchene (david.duchene@anu.edu.au).
